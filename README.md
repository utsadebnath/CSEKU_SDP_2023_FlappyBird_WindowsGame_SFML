## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio with latest version installed](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [SFML library with latest version](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio**: Launch Microsoft Visual Studio and select "Open a project or solution." Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `.sln` file.

3. **Configure SFML**: Make sure to configure SFML properly in your Visual Studio project. You need to set up include directories, library directories, and link dependencies. Refer to the SFML documentation or any guides available online for detailed instructions on how to do this.

4. **Build the Project**: Build the project within Visual Studio. This will compile your C++ code and create the executable for the game.

5. **Run the Game**: After building successfully, you can run the game by clicking the "Start" button in Visual Studio or by navigating to the output directory where the executable is located and running it from there.

## How to Play
- Press **Enter** to start the Game.
- Press the **Spacebar** to make the character (Bird) jump.
- Navigate the character through the openings between the pipes.
- The game ends when the character collides with the ground or a pipe.
- Your goal is to achieve the highest possible score by surviving as long as you can.

## Project Description :

	Flappy Bird was a popular side-scrolling mobile game first released on 24th May 2013  and became a sensation overnight in early 2014. 
	Flappy Bird was removed from both the App Store and Google Play by showing its addictive nature and over usage. So, to play and introduced 
	the flappy bird game on a Windows environment, we proposed a system that is designed to give a minimalistic and simplistic look and feel 
	with lots and lots of new graphics. To provide a user-friendly and consistent experience, we use C++ language and SFML for graphics and 
	its various functions and functionalities. In the game, the player controls a bird and navigates through sets of pipes without hitting them. 
	The game is simple in concept, but challenging in practice, as the player must keep the bird flying by tapping the screen or pressing a key. 
	Each successful pass through a set of pipes results in the player gaining a point, and the game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground. 
	The game's addictive nature and simple, yet challenging gameplay have made it a popular choice among casual gamers.
